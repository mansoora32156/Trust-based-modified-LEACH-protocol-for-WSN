# Trust-based-modified-LEACH-protocol-for-WSN
This project's intent is to create a multi-objective Routing protocol for increasing the energy efficiency and security of WSNs by addressing both challenges. This involves identifying potential vulnerabilities in the network, as well as implementing new protocol that can help sensors protect against attacks.
This project's objective is to create strategies for increasing the energy efficiency and security
of WSNs. By addressing both of these challenges, WSNs can be more reliable and effective
in a wide range of applications. This will involve identifying and addressing potential
vulnerabilities in the networks, as well as developing and implementing new protocols that
can help sensors protect against attacks.
Another important aspect of the research will be determining the efficiency of the offered
techniques through simulations and experiments, and to identify any potential trade-offs or
limitations. By improving the energy efficiency and security of WSNs, this work will help to
advance the use of these networks in a wide range of applications, and to ensure that they can
operate reliably and securely in challenging environments
